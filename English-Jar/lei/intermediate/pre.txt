<DOC>
12.44 seconds to  boot
</DOC>
<DOC>
3d rendering  slows it down considerably
</DOC>
<DOC>
a lot of  features  and  shortcuts  on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal pc.
</DOC>
<DOC>
a veryimportant feature is  firewire 800  which in my experience works better then  usb3  in pc enabled with  usb3 i was not originally sold on the  mac os  i felt it was inferior in many ways to  windows 7
</DOC>
<DOC>
additionally, there is barely a  ventilation system  in the computer, and even the simple activity of  watching videos  let alone  playing steam games  causes the laptop to get very very hot, and in fact impossible to keep on lap.
</DOC>
<DOC>
after all was said and done, i essentially used that 450 savings to buy  16gb of ram , two  seagate momentus xt hybrid drives  and an  owc upgrade kit  to install the second  hard drive
</DOC>
<DOC>
after fumbling around with the  os  i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue.
</DOC>
<DOC>
after replacing the  spinning hard disk  with an  ssd drive , my mac is just flying.
</DOC>
<DOC>
air has higher  resolution  but the  fonts  are small.
</DOC>
<DOC>
all the  ports  are much needed since this is my main computer.
</DOC>
<DOC>
also stunning  colors  and speedy
</DOC>
<DOC>
also, in using the  builtin camera , my  voice recording  for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the star wars saga.
</DOC>
<DOC>
also... excellent  operating system   size  and  weight  for optimal  mobility  excellent  durability of the battery  the  functions provided by the trackpad  is unmatched by any other brand
</DOC>
<DOC>
amazing  performance  for anything i throw at it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
and  windows 7  works like a charm.
</DOC>
<DOC>
and as for all the fancy  finger swipes   i just gave up and attached a  mouse
</DOC>
<DOC>
and i may be the only one but i am really liking  windows 8
</DOC>
<DOC>
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a  case  to protect it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
and mine had broke but i sent it in under  warranty no problems.
</DOC>
<DOC>
and the  speakers  is the worst ever.
</DOC>
<DOC>
and the fact that apple is driving the 13 rmbp with the  intel4000 graphic chip  seems underpowered to me.
</DOC>
<DOC>
and the fact that it comes with an  i5 processor  definitely speeds things up
</DOC>
<DOC>
apple help  is a mixed bag
</DOC>
<DOC>
apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective  design  involving the  intel 4000 graphics chipset
</DOC>
<DOC>
apple is unmatched in  product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and  customer service
</DOC>
<DOC>
apple no longer includes  idvd  with the computer and furthermore, apple doesnt even offer it anymore!
</DOC>
<DOC>
apple removed the  dvd drive firewire port  will work with  adapter  and put the  sdxc slot  in a silly position on the back.
</DOC>
<DOC>
as far as user type  i dabble in everything from  games  wow to  photoshop , but nothing professionally.
</DOC>
<DOC>
at first, i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the  mac system
</DOC>
<DOC>
at home and the office it gets plugged into an  external 24 lcd screen , so  built in screen size  is not terribly important.
</DOC>
<DOC>
awesome  form factor , great  battery life , wonderful  ux
</DOC>
<DOC>
biggest complaint is  windows 8
</DOC>
<DOC>
boot time  is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute
</DOC>
<DOC>
bootup  slowed significantly after all  windows updates  were installed
</DOC>
<DOC>
builtin apps  are purely amazing
</DOC>
<DOC>
but  office  can be purchased if i ever need a laptop again i am for sure purchasing another toshiba!
</DOC>
<DOC>
but i do not like  win8
</DOC>
<DOC>
but i wanted the pro for the  cddvd player
</DOC>
<DOC>
but i was completely wrong, this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to  use
</DOC>
<DOC>
but the  mountain lion  is just too slow.
</DOC>
<DOC>
but the  performance  of mac mini is a huge disappointment.
</DOC>
<DOC>
but with this laptop, the  bass  is very weak and the  sound  comes out sounding tinny.
</DOC>
<DOC>
buy the separate  ram memory  and you will have a rocket!
</DOC>
<DOC>
came with  iphoto  and  garage band  already loaded.
</DOC>
<DOC>
can you buy any laptop that matches the  quality  of a macbook?
</DOC>
<DOC>
chatting with  acer support , i was advised the problem was corrupted  operating system files
</DOC>
<DOC>
cons:  price  is a bit ridiculous, kinda heavy.
</DOC>
<DOC>
cons:  screen resolution
</DOC>
<DOC>
cost  is more as compared to other brands
</DOC>
<DOC>
customization  on mac is impossible
</DOC>
<DOC>
did not enjoy the new  windows 8  and  touchscreen functions
</DOC>
<DOC>
does everything i need it to, has a wonderful  battery life  and i couldnt be happier.
</DOC>
<DOC>
easy to  customize setting  and even  create your own bookmarks
</DOC>
<DOC>
easy to  install  also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to  configure for adsl cable or wifi
</DOC>
<DOC>
easy to  set up  and go!
</DOC>
<DOC>
enjoy using  microsoft office
</DOC>
<DOC>
every time i  log into the system  after a few hours, there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through.
</DOC>
<DOC>
everything i wanted and everything i needed and the  price  was great!
</DOC>
<DOC>
everything is so easy and intuitive to  setup  or  configure
</DOC>
<DOC>
exactly as posted plus a great  value
</DOC>
<DOC>
excelent  performance ,  usability ,  presentation  and  time response
</DOC>
<DOC>
fan  only comes on when you are  playing a gam
</DOC>
<DOC>
fast, great  screen , beautiful  apps  for a laptop; priced  at 1100 on the apple website;amazon had it for 1098 tax   plus i had a 10 off coupon from amazon cost  me 998 plus tax 1070 otd!
</DOC>
<DOC>
fine if you have a  touch screen
</DOC>
<DOC>
first of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed  aluminum
</DOC>
<DOC>
first off, i really do like my mbp... once used to the  os  it is pretty easy to get around, and the  overall build  is great... eg the  keyboard  is one of the best to type on.
</DOC>
<DOC>
from the  speed  to the  multi touch gestures  this  operating system  beats  windows  easily.
</DOC>
<DOC>
further, this mac mini has a sloppy  bluetooth interface  courtesy of the  mac os  and the  range  is poor.
</DOC>
<DOC>
got this mac mini with  os x mountain lion  for my wife.
</DOC>
<DOC>
graphics  are much improved
</DOC>
<DOC>
great  performance  and  quality
</DOC>
<DOC>
great  price  free  shipping  what else can i ask for!
</DOC>
<DOC>
great product, great  price , great  delivery , and great  service
</DOC>
<DOC>
harddrive  was in poor condition, had to replace it
</DOC>
<DOC>
has all the other  features  i wanted including a  vga port ,  hdmi ,  ethernet  and 3  usb ports
</DOC>
<DOC>
having  usb3  is why i bought this mini.
</DOC>
<DOC>
having heard from friends and family about how reliable a mac product is, i never expected to have an  application  crash within the first month, but i did.
</DOC>
<DOC>
here are the things that made me confident with my purchase: build quality   seriously, you cant beat a  unibody construction
</DOC>
<DOC>
however i chose two day  shipping  and it took over a week to arrive.
</DOC>
<DOC>
however, i can refute that  osx  is fast.
</DOC>
<DOC>
however, it did not have any scratches, zero  battery cycle count  pretty surprised, and all the  hardware  seemed to be working perfectly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
however, the experience was great since the  os  does not become unstable and the  application  will simply shutdown and reopen.
</DOC>
<DOC>
however, there are major issues with the  touchpad  which render the device nearly useless.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i also made a  recovery usb stick
</DOC>
<DOC>
i also wanted  windows 7 , which this one has.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i am loving the fast  performance  also.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i am please with the products ease of  use ; out of the box ready;  appearance  and  functionality
</DOC>
<DOC>
i am pleased with the fast  log on , speedy  wifi connection  and the long  battery life  6 hrs.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i am replacing the  hd  with a  micron ssd  soon.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i am still in the process of learning about its  features
</DOC>
<DOC>
i am used to computers with  windows  so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i blame the  mac os
</DOC>
<DOC>
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small, portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a  word processing program  to do so.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i bought it to my son who uses it for  graphic design
</DOC>
<DOC>
i called toshiba where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the  mother boards
</DOC>
<DOC>
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the  performance  that the computer has supplied.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i cant believe how quiet the  hard drive  is and how quick this thing  boots up
</DOC>
<DOC>
i did add a  ssd drive  and  memory
</DOC>
<DOC>
i did swap out the  hard drive  for a  samsung 830 ssd  which i highly recommend.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i do not like too much  windows 8
</DOC>
<DOC>
i found the mini to be:exceptionally easy to  set up
</DOC>
<DOC>
i got the new  adapter  and there was no change.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i got this at an amazing  price  from amazon and it arrived just in time.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i had the same reasons as most pc users: the  price , the overbearing restrictions of  osx  and lack of  support for games
</DOC>
<DOC>
i had to  install mountain lion  and it took a good two hours.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i had to buy a  wireless mouse  to go with it, as i am old school and hate the  pad , but knew that before i bought it, now it  works  great, need to get adjusted to the  key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i had to get  apple customer support  to correct the problem.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new  os
</DOC>
<DOC>
i have been pc for years but this computer is intuitive and its  built in features  are a great help
</DOC>
<DOC>
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a  slim plastic case  covering it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i have experienced no problems,  works  as anticipated.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i have had it over a year now with out a glitch of any kind..i love the  lit up keys  and  screen display ...this thing is fast and clear as can be.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i havent tried the one with  retina display ... maybe in the future.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i just bought the new macbook pro, the 13 model, and i cant believe apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to  usb ports
</DOC>
<DOC>
i know some people complained about  hdmi  issues but they released a  firmware patch  to address that issue.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i like  itunes , the apparent  security , the  mini form factor , all the nice  graphics stuff
</DOC>
<DOC>
i like coming back to  mac os  but this laptop is lacking in  speaker quality  compared to my 400  old hp laptop.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i like the  brightness  and  adjustments
</DOC>
<DOC>
i like the  design  and ease of use with the  keyboard , plenty of  ports
</DOC>
<DOC>
i like the  design  and its  features  but there are somethings i think needs to be improved.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i like the  lighted screen  at night.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i like the  operating system
</DOC>
<DOC>
i like the mini mac it was easy to  setup  and  install , but i am learning as i go and could use a  tutorial  to learn how to use some of the  features  i was use to on the pc especially the  right mouse click menu
</DOC>
<DOC>
i love the  form factor
</DOC>
<DOC>
i love the  keyboard  and the  screen
</DOC>
<DOC>
i love the quick  start up
</DOC>
<DOC>
i needed a laptop with big  storage , a nice  screen  and fast so i can  photoshop  without any problem.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i never tried any  external mics  with that imac.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i only wish this mac had a  cddvd player  built in.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i opted for the  squaretrade 3year computer accidental protection warranty  15002000 which also support accidents like drops and spills that are not covered by  applecare
</DOC>
<DOC>
i ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with  spec  of the new 27 imacs.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i really like the  size  and im a fan of the acers.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i reseated the  wlan card  inside and reinstalled the  lan device drivers
</DOC>
<DOC>
i seem to be having repeat problems as the  mother board  in this one is diagnosed as faulty, related to the  graphics card
</DOC>
<DOC>
i switched to this because i wanted something different, even though i miss  windows
</DOC>
<DOC>
i then upgraded to  mac os x 10.8 mountain lion
</DOC>
<DOC>
i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this  price point
</DOC>
<DOC>
i thought that it will be fine, if i do some  settings
</DOC>
<DOC>
i thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new  mac ecosystem
</DOC>
<DOC>
i tried several  monitors  and several  hdmi cables  and this was the case each time.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i understand i should call  apple tech support  about any variableswhich is my purpose of writing this con as variables could be a bigger future problem.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i use it mostly for  content creation   audio ,  video ,  photo editing  and its reliable.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i used  windows xp ,  windows vista , and  windows 7  extensively.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i want the  portability  of a tablet, without the limitations of a tablet and thats where this laptop comes into play.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i wanted a computer that was quite, fast, and that had overall great  performance
</DOC>
<DOC>
i wanted it for its  mobility  and man, this little bad boy is very nice.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was a little concerned about the  touch pad  based on reviews, but ive found it fine to work with.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was a little worry at first because i dont have a lot of experience with  os.x  and  windows  has always been second nature to me after many years of using  windows
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was also informed that the  components  of the mac book were dirty.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was amazed at how fast the  delivery  was.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was concerned that the downgrade to the  regular hard drive  would make it unacceptably slow but i need not have worried  this machine is the fastest i have ever owned.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was considering buying the air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful  performance  and seems much more convenient, even though its about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was extremely happy with the  os  itself.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was given a demonstration of  windows 8
</DOC>
<DOC>
i was having a though time deciding between the 13 macbook air or the macbook pro 13 both baseline models,  priced  at 1,200  retail
</DOC>
<DOC>
i will  upgrade the ram  myself because with this model you can you can do it later on.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i will not be using that  slot  again.
</DOC>
<DOC>
i work as a designer and coder and i needed a new buddy to work with, not  gaming
</DOC>
<DOC>
i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had  windows 8
</DOC>
<DOC>
if yo like  practicality  this is the laptop for you.
</DOC>
<DOC>
if you ask me, for this  price  it should be included.
</DOC>
<DOC>
if you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the  start menu  will automatically come up.
</DOC>
<DOC>
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the  applications
</DOC>
<DOC>
im overall pleased with the  interface  and the  portability  of this product.
</DOC>
<DOC>
im using this computer for  word processing ,  web browsing , some  gaming , and im learning  programming
</DOC>
<DOC>
in fact i still use many legacy programs   appleworks ,  filemaker pro ,  quicken ,  photoshop  etc!
</DOC>
<DOC>
incredible  graphics  and brilliant  colors
</DOC>
<DOC>
instead, ill focus more on the actual  performance and feature set of the hardware  itself so you can make an educated decision on which mac to buy.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it  looks  and  feels  solid, with a flawless  finish
</DOC>
<DOC>
it  wakes  in less than a second when i open the  lid
</DOC>
<DOC>
it  works  fine, and all the  software  seems to run pretty well.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it  works  great and i am so happy i bought it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it also comes with  4g of ram  but if youre like me you want to max that out so i immediately put  8g of ram  in her and ive never used a computer that  performs  better.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it arrived so fast and  customer service  was great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it came in brand new and  works  perfectly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it definitely beats my old mac and the  service  was great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it feels cheap, the  keyboard  is not very sensitive.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it has a very high  performance , just for what i needed for.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it has all the  features  that we expected and the  price  was good,  working  well so far.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it has all the expected  features  and more plus a wide  screen  and more than roomy  keyboard
</DOC>
<DOC>
it has enough  memory  and  speed  to run my business with all the  flexibility  that comes with a laptop.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it has so much more  speed  and the  screen  is very sharp.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is a great  size  and amazing  windows 8  included!
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is fast and easy to  use
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is lightweight and the perfect  size  to carry to class.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is made of such solid  construction  and since i have never had a mac using my iphone helped me get used to the  system  a bit.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is pretty snappy and  starts up  in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is really easy to  use  and it is quick to  start up
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is really thick around the  battery
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is robust, with a friendly  use  as all apple products.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is super fast and has outstanding  graphics
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is the perfect  size  and  speed  for me.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is very easy to  integrate bluetooth devices , and  usb devices  are recognized almost instantly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is very easy to  navigate  even for a novice.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a  word program
</DOC>
<DOC>
it is very slim, the  track pad  is very much impressed with me.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it just  works  out of the box and you have a lot of cool  software  included with the  os
</DOC>
<DOC>
it provides much more  flexibility for connectivity
</DOC>
<DOC>
it shouldnt happen like that, i dont have any  design app  open or anything.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it still  works  and its extremely user friendly, so i would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
</DOC>
<DOC>
it suddenly can not  work
</DOC>
<DOC>
it was also suffering from  hardware keyboard  issues, relatively slow  performance  and shortening  battery lifetime
</DOC>
<DOC>
it was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the  internet ,  word processing ,  graphic design  and  gaming
</DOC>
<DOC>
its  size  is ideal and the  weight  is acceptable.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its a decent computer for the  price  and hopefully it will last a long time.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its absolutely wonderful and worth the  price
</DOC>
<DOC>
its as advertised on here..... it  works  great and is not a waste of money!
</DOC>
<DOC>
its been a couple weeks since the purchase and im struggle with finding the correct  keys  but that was expected.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its been time for a new laptop, and the only debate was which  size  of the mac laptops, and whether to spring for the  retina display
</DOC>
<DOC>
its exactly what i wanted, and it has all the new  features  and whatnot.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its fast at  loading the internet
</DOC>
<DOC>
its fast, easy to  use  and it  looks  great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its fast, light, and is perfect for  media editing , which is mostly why i bought it in the first place.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its fast, light, and simple to  use
</DOC>
<DOC>
its great for  streaming video  and other  entertainment uses
</DOC>
<DOC>
its just what we were looking for and it  works  great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its light and easy to  transport
</DOC>
<DOC>
its not inexpensive but the  hardware performance  is impressive for a computer this small.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its ok but doesnt have a  disk drive  which i didnt know until after i bought it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its silent and has a very small  footprint  on my desk.
</DOC>
<DOC>
its so nice that the  battery  last so long and that this machine has the  snow lion
</DOC>
<DOC>
its so quick and responsive that it makes  working  surfing  on a computer so much more pleasurable!
</DOC>
<DOC>
its the best, its got the  looks , super easy to  use  and love all you can do with the  trackpad
</DOC>
<DOC>
ive already upgraded o  mavericks  and i am impressed with everything about this computer.
</DOC>
<DOC>
ive had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with  software  or  updates
</DOC>
<DOC>
ive had my computer for 2 weeks already and it  works  perfectly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
ive installed to it additional  ssd  and  16gb ram
</DOC>
<DOC>
ive lived with the crashes and slow  operation  and restarts.
</DOC>
<DOC>
just beware no  dvd slot  so when i went to  install software  i had on cd i couldnt.
</DOC>
<DOC>
keyboard  responds well to presses
</DOC>
<DOC>
lastly,  windows 8  is annoying.
</DOC>
<DOC>
logic board  utterly fried, cried, and laid down and died
</DOC>
<DOC>
luckily, for all of us contemplating the decision, the mac mini is  priced  just right.
</DOC>
<DOC>
mac tutorials  do help
</DOC>
<DOC>
made  interneting  part of my business very difficult to maintain.
</DOC>
<DOC>
many people complain about the new  os , and its urgent for apple to fix it asap!
</DOC>
<DOC>
maybe the  mac os  improvement were not the product they want to offer.
</DOC>
<DOC>
more likely it will require replacing the  logic board  once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution.
</DOC>
<DOC>
ms office 2011 for mac  is wonderful, well worth it
</DOC>
<DOC>
my  trackpad  is not working.
</DOC>
<DOC>
my laptop with  windows 7  crashed and i did not want  windows 8
</DOC>
<DOC>
my last laptop was a 17 asus gaming machine, which  performed  admirably, but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life, i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome, not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago.
</DOC>
<DOC>
my one complaint is that there was no  internal cd drive
</DOC>
<DOC>
my only complaint is the total lack of  instructions  that come with the mac mini.
</DOC>
<DOC>
my only gripe would be the need to add more  ram
</DOC>
<DOC>
my wife was so excited to open the box, but quickly came to see that it did not  function  as it should.
</DOC>
<DOC>
needs a  cddvd drive  and a bigger  power switch
</DOC>
<DOC>
nice  packing
</DOC>
<DOC>
nice  screen ,  keyboard  works great!
</DOC>
<DOC>
no  cd rom  in the new version theres no way im spending that kind of money on something has less  features  than the older version.
</DOC>
<DOC>
no  hdmi port
</DOC>
<DOC>
no  installation disk dvd  is included.
</DOC>
<DOC>
no  startup disk  was not included but that may be my fault.
</DOC>
<DOC>
not as fast as i would have expect for an  i5
</DOC>
<DOC>
not sure on  windows 8
</DOC>
<DOC>
not too expense and has enough  storage  for most users and many  ports
</DOC>
<DOC>
note, however, that any existing  magsafe accessories  you have will not work with the  magsafe 2 connection
</DOC>
<DOC>
now that i have upgraded to  lion  i am much happier about  mac os  and have just bought an imac for office.
</DOC>
<DOC>
on  start up  it asks endless questions just so  itune  can sell you more of their products.
</DOC>
<DOC>
once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed  windows 8 setup  you may feel frustrated.
</DOC>
<DOC>
one more thing, this mac does not come with  restore disks  and i am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pcs, also the  charging cables  are made of the same cheap  material  as the iphoneipod touch cables.
</DOC>
<DOC>
only 2  usb ports ...seems kind of...limited.
</DOC>
<DOC>
only problem that i had was that the  track pad  was not very good for me, i only had a problem once or twice with it, but probably my computer was a bit defective.

</DOC>
<DOC>
performance  is much much better on the pro, especially if you install an  ssd  on it

<DOC>
plus  two finger clicking  as a replacement for the  right click button  is surprisingly intuitive.
</DOC>
<DOC>
premium  price  for the  os  more than anything else.
</DOC>
<DOC>
price  was higher when purchased on mac when compared to  price  showing on pc when i bought this product
</DOC>

<DOC>
simple details, crafted  aluminium  and real  glass  make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops.
</DOC>
<DOC>
since the machines slim  profile  is critical to me, that was a problem.
</DOC>
<DOC>

<DOC>
strong  build  though which really adds to its  durability
</DOC>
<DOC>
super light, super sexy and everything just  works
</DOC>
<DOC>
sure its not light and slim but the  features  make up for it 100.
</DOC>
<DOC>
system  is running great
</DOC>
<DOC>
tech support  would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for 150 plus
</DOC>
<DOC>
thank goodness for  openoffice
</DOC>
<DOC>
thanks for great  service  and  shipping
</DOC>
<DOC>
thanks for the fast  shipment  and great  price
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  2.9ghz dualcore i7 chip  really out does itself.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  aluminum body  sure makes it stand out.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  audio volume  is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  baterry  is very longer.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  battery  is not as shown in the product photos.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  battery  lasts as advertised give or take 1520 minutes, and the entire  user experience  is very elegant.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  battery  was completely dead, in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  battery life  is excellent 67 hours without charging.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  battery life  is excellent, the  display  is excellent, and  downloading apps  is a  breeze.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  built quality  is really good, i was so happy and excited about this product.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  case  is now slightly larger than the previous generation, but the lack of an  external power supply  justifies the small increase in size.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  configuration  is perfect for my needs.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  customer service  is terrific!
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  durability  of the laptop will make it worth the money.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  exterior  is absolutely gorgeous.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  hardware  problems have been so bad, i cant wait till it completely dies in 3 years, tops!
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  memory  was gone and it was not able to be used.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  mountain lion os  is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with  microsoft windows
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  onoff switch  is a bit obscure in the rear corner.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  os  is easy, and offers all kinds of surprises.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  os  is fast and fluid, everything is organized and its just beautiful.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  os  is great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  performance  is definitely superior to any computer ive ever put my hands on.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  performance  seems quite good, and  builtin applications  like  iphoto  work great with my phone and camera.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  power plug  has to be connected to the  power adaptor  to charge the  battery  but wont stay connected.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  price  is 200 dollars down.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  retina display display  make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  screen , the  software  and the smoothness of the  operating system
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  sd card reader  is slightly recessed and upside down the  nail slot on the card  cannot be accessed, if this was a self ejecting  slot  this would not be an issue, but its not.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  settings  are not userfriendly either.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  sound  is nice and loud; i dont have any problems with hearing anything.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  sound  was crappy even when you turn up the  volume  still the same results.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  specs  are pretty good too.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  speed , the  simplicity , the  design .. it is lightyears ahead of any pc i have ever owned.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  superdrive  is quiet.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  technical support  was not helpful as well.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  thunderbolt port  is awesome!
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  unibody construction  really does feel lot more solid than apples previous laptops.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  volume  is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t  volume  to be so lowan i hate that about this computer
</DOC>
<DOC>
the apple engineers have not yet discovered the  delete key
</DOC>
<DOC>
the criticism has waned, and now id be the first to recommend an air for truly  portable computing
</DOC>
<DOC>
the dell inspiron is fast and has a  number pad on the keyboard , which i miss on my apple laptops.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the first time i used the  card reader  it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to  remove the card
</DOC>
<DOC>
the latest version does not have a  disc drive
</DOC>
<DOC>
the like new condition of the imac mc309lla on amazon is at 900 level only, and it is a  quadcore 2.5 ghz cpu  similar to the 799 mini, with  radeon hd 6750m 512mb graphic card  this mini is  integrated intel 4000 card , and it even comes with  wireless apple keyboard and mouse , all put together in neat and nice  package
</DOC>
<DOC>
the mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and  runs  very quiet, actually the  fans  arent audible unlike my old pc
</DOC>
<DOC>
the mac mini is probably the simplest example of  compact computing  out there.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the mac mini,  wireless keyboard  mouse  and a  hdmi cable  is all i need to get some real work done.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the macbook pros  physical form  is wonderful.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the mbp is beautiful has many wonderful  capabilities
</DOC>
<DOC>
the minis  body  hasnt changed since late 2010 and for a good reason.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the new  operating system  makes this computer into a super ipad.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the new  os  is great on my macbook pro!
</DOC>
<DOC>
the new mbp offers great  portability  and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the nicest  part is the low  heat output  and ultra quiet  operation
</DOC>
<DOC>
the only issue came when i tried  scanning  to the mac.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the only solution is to turn the  brightness  down, etc.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be  gaming , otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the only thing i dislike about this laptop are the  rubber pads  found on the bottom of the computer for grip.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the only thing i dislike is the  touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things i dont want it too, i would recommend using a  mouse  with it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the only thing i miss are the  homeend type keys  and other things that i grew accustomed to after so long.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the only thing i miss is that my old alienware laptop had  backlit keys
</DOC>
<DOC>
the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their  design  and the  aluminum casing
</DOC>
<DOC>
the receiver was full of superlatives for the  quality  and  performance
</DOC>
<DOC>
the smaller  size  was a bonus because of space restrictions.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the sound as mentioned earlier isnt the best, but it can be solved with  headphones
</DOC>
<DOC>
the troubleshooting said it was the  ac adaptor  so we ordered a new one.
</DOC>
<DOC>
then the  system  would many times not  power down  without a forced poweroff.
</DOC>
<DOC>
there is no  hdmi receptacle , nor is there an  sd card slot  located anywhere on the device.
</DOC>
<DOC>
there is no  tools menu
</DOC>
<DOC>
there were small problems with  mac office
</DOC>
<DOC>
they are simpler to  use
</DOC>
<DOC>
they dont just  look  good; they deliver excellent  performance
</DOC>
<DOC>
this  hardware  seems to be better than the imac in that it isnt 1400 and smaller.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this  mouse  is terrific.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this by far beats any computer out on the market today  built  well,  battery life  amazing.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this computer is also awesome for my sons  virtual home schooling
</DOC>
<DOC>
this item is a beautiful piece, it  works  well, it is easy to  carry  and  handle
</DOC>
<DOC>
this laptop has only 2  usb ports , and they are both on the same side.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this mac does come with an  extender cable  and im using mine right now hoping the  cable  will stay nice for the many years i plan on using this mac.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this mac mini does not have a  builtin mic , and it would seem that its  mac os 10.9  does not handle  external microphones  properly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this macbook pro is fast, powerful, and  runs  super quiet and cool.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this newer netbook has no  hard drive  or  network lights
</DOC>
<DOC>
this one still has the  cd slot
</DOC>
<DOC>
this thing is awesome, everything always  works , everything is always easy to  set up , everything is compatible, its literally everything i could ask for.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this version of macbook pro runs on a  thirdgeneration cpu ivy bridge , not the latest  fourthgeneration haswell cpu  the 2013 version has.
</DOC>
<DOC>
though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the  sound quality  isnt superb.
</DOC>
<DOC>
took a long time trying to decide between one with  retina display  and one without.
</DOC>
<DOC>
tried  windows 8  and hated it
</DOC>
<DOC>
unfortunately, it runs  xp  and microsoft is dropping  support  next april.
</DOC>
<DOC>
usb3 peripherals  are noticably less expensive than the  thunderbolt  ones
</DOC>
<DOC>
user upgradeable  ram  and  hdd
</DOC>
<DOC>
very nice  unibody construction
</DOC>
<DOC>
wasnt sure if i was going to like it much less love it so i went to a local best buy and played around with the  ios system  on a mac pro and it was totally unique and different.
</DOC>
<DOC>
web browsing  is very quick with  safari browse
</DOC>
<DOC>
web surfuring  is smooth and seamless
</DOC>
<DOC>
well  designed  and fast.
</DOC>
<DOC>
when considering a mac, look at the total  cost of ownership  and not just the initial  price tag
</DOC>
<DOC>
which it did not have, only 3  usb 2 ports
</DOC>
<DOC>
wifi capability ,  disk drive  and multiple  usb ports  to connect scale and printers was all that was required
</DOC>
<DOC>
with the  softwares  supporting the use of other  os  makes it much better.
</DOC>
<DOC>
with the needs of a professional photographer i generally need to keep up with the best  specs
</DOC>
<DOC>
within a few hours i was using the  gestures  unconsciously.
</DOC>
<DOC>
working  with mac is so much easier, so many cool  feature
</DOC>
<DOC>
works  well, and i am extremely happy to be back to an  apple o
</DOC>
<DOC>
yes, thats a good thing, but its made from  aluminum  that scratches easily.
</DOC>
<DOC>
yet my mac continues to  function  properly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
you just cannot beat the  functionality  of an apple device.
</DOC>
