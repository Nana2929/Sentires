<DOC>
 Boot time  is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 tech support  would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $150 plus.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Set up  was easy.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Did not enjoy the new  Windows 8  and  touchscreen functions .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Other than not being a fan of  click pads  (industry standard these days) and the lousy  internal speakers , it's hard for me to find things about this notebook I don't like, especially considering the $350  price tag .
</DOC>
<DOC>
No  installation disk (DVD)  is included.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's fast, light, and simple to  use .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Works  well, and I am extremely happy to be back to an  apple OS .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Sure it's not light and slim but the  features  make up for it 100%.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I am pleased with the fast  log on , speedy  WiFi connection  and the long  battery life  (>6 hrs).
</DOC>
<DOC>
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the  delete key .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Made  interneting  (part of my business) very difficult to maintain.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Luckily, for all of us contemplating the decision, the Mac Mini is  priced  just right.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Super light, super sexy and everything just  works .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Only problem that I had was that the  track pad  was not very good for me, I only had a problem once or twice with it, But probably my computer was a bit defective.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is super fast and has outstanding  graphics .
</DOC>
<DOC>
But the  mountain lion  is just too slow.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Strong  build  though which really adds to its  durability .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  battery life  is excellent- 6-7 hours without charging.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it  works  perfectly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
And I may be the only one but I am really liking  Windows 8 .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  baterry  is very longer.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Its  size  is ideal and the  weight  is acceptable.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the  performance  that the computer has supplied.
</DOC>
<DOC>
This laptop has only 2  USB ports , and they are both on the same side.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It has so much more  speed  and the  screen  is very sharp.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the  price  was great!
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's not inexpensive but the  Hardware performance  is impressive for a computer this small.
</DOC>
<DOC>
This thing is awesome, everything always  works , everything is always easy to  set up , everything is compatible, its literally everything I could ask for.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Keyboard  responds well to presses.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Lastly,  Windows 8  is annoying.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Everything is so easy and intuitive to  setup  or  configure .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Biggest complaint is  Windows 8  .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Only 2  usb ports ...seems kind of...limited.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It has all the expected  features  and more +plus a wide  screen  and more than roomy  keyboard .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Amazing  Performance  for anything I throw at it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The receiver was full of superlatives for the  quality  and  performance .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was extremely happy with the  OS  itself.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The new MBP offers great  portability  and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly  portable computing .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had  Windows 8 
</DOC>
<DOC>
 MS Office 2011 for Mac  is wonderful, well worth it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
But the  performance  of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment.
</DOC>
<DOC>
They don't just  look  good; they deliver excellent  performance .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kind..I love the  lit up keys  and  screen display ...this thing is Fast and clear as can be.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  Mountain Lion OS  is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with  Microsoft Windows .
</DOC>
<DOC>
However, I can refute that  OSX  is "FAST".
</DOC>
<DOC>
Enjoy using  Microsoft Office !
</DOC>
<DOC>
Incredible  graphics  and brilliant  colors .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Built-in apps  are purely amazing.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Cons:  Screen resolution .
</DOC>
<DOC>
From the  speed  to the  multi touch gestures  this  operating system  beats  Windows  easily.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I really like the  size  and I'm a fan of the ACERS.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I opted for the  SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty  ($1500-2000) which also support "accidents" like drops and spills that are NOT covered by  AppleCare .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's light and easy to  transport .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed  Windows 8 Set-Up  you may feel frustrated.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's been time for a new laptop, and the only debate was which  size  of the Mac laptops, and whether to spring for the  retina display .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their  design  and the  aluminum casing .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  aluminum body  sure makes it stand out.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is very easy to  integrate bluetooth devices , and  USB devices  are recognized almost instantly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13" RMBP with the  Intel4000 graphic chip  seems underpowered (to me.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Apple removed the  DVD drive Firewire port  (will work with  adapter ) and put the  SDXC slot  in a silly position on the back.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  durability  of the laptop will make it worth the money.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Well  designed  and fast.
</DOC>
<DOC>
But I was completely wrong, this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to  use .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Exactly as posted plus a great  value .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  specs  are pretty good too.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Apple is unmatched in  product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and  customer service .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is a great  size  and amazing  windows 8  included!
</DOC>
<DOC>
I do not like too much  Windows 8 .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Startup times  are incredibly long: over two minutes.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Also stunning  colors  and speedy
</DOC>
<DOC>
great  price  free  shipping  what else can i ask for!!
</DOC>
<DOC>
This  mouse  is terrific.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is really thick around the  battery .
</DOC>
<DOC>
And  windows 7  works like a charm.
</DOC>
<DOC>
:) Great product, great  price , great  delivery , and great  service .
</DOC>
<DOC>
:] It arrived so fast and  customer service  was great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
tried  windows 8  and hated it !!!
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Set up  was a breeze.
</DOC>
<DOC>
But I do NOT like  Win8 .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I am still in the process of learning about its  features .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I had the same reasons as most PC users: the  price , the overbearing restrictions of  OSX  and lack of  support for games .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I wanted it for it's  mobility  and man, this little bad boy is very nice.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I found the mini to be:Exceptionally easy to  set up 
</DOC>
<DOC>
Having  USB3  is why I bought this Mini.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  sound  is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is very slim, the  track pad  is very much impressed with me.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  settings  are not user-friendly either.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Thank goodness for  OpenOffice !
</DOC>
<DOC>
Awesome  form factor , great  battery life , wonderful  UX .
</DOC>
<DOC>
i love the  keyboard  and the  screen .
</DOC>
<DOC>
However, there are MAJOR issues with the  touchpad  which render the device nearly useless.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I've already upgraded o  Mavericks  and I am impressed with everything about this computer.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Not as fast as I would have expect for an  i5 .
</DOC>
<DOC>
thanks for great  service  and  shipping !
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  performance  seems quite good, and  built-in applications  like  iPhoto  work great with my phone and camera.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I did swap out the  hard drive  for a  Samsung 830 SSD  which I highly recommend.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Starts up  in a hurry and everything is ready to go.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from  aluminum  that scratches easily.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Quick and has  built in virus control .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Took a long time trying to decide between one with  retina display  and one without.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was also informed that the  components  of the Mac Book were dirty.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  hardware  problems have been so bad, i can't wait till it completely dies in 3 years, TOPS!
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's so nice that the  battery  last so long and that this machine has the  snow lion !
</DOC>
<DOC>
HOWEVER I chose two day  shipping  and it took over a week to arrive.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it's exactly what i wanted, and it has all the new  features  and whatnot.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Can you buy any laptop that matches the  quality  of a MacBook?
</DOC>
<DOC>
It feels cheap, the  keyboard  is not very sensitive.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the  sound quality  isnt superb.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is very easy to  navigate  even for a novice.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Does everything I need it to, has a wonderful  battery life  and I couldn't be happier.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Great  Performance  and  Quality .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I used  windows XP ,  windows Vista , and  Windows 7  extensively.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I did add a  SSD drive  and  memory 
</DOC>
<DOC>
On  start up  it asks endless questions just so  itune  can sell you more of their products.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new  OS .
</DOC>
<DOC>
One more thing, this mac does NOT come with  restore disks  and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the  charging cables  are made of the same cheap  material  as the iPhone/iPod touch cables.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I bought it to my son who uses it for  graphic design .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I never tried any  external mics  with that iMac.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The new  os  is great on my macbook pro!
</DOC>
<DOC>
I have experienced no problems,  works  as anticipated.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 System  is running great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Easy to  customize setting  and even  create your own bookmarks .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The MAC Mini,  wireless keyboard / mouse  and a  HDMI cable  is all I need to get some real work done.
</DOC>
<DOC>
it has all the  features  that we expected and the  price  was good,  working  well so far.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with, not  gaming .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The new  operating system  makes this computer into a super iPad.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Easy to  set up  and go!
</DOC>
<DOC>
I can't believe how quiet the  hard drive  is and how quick this thing  boots up .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The only issue came when I tried  scanning  to the mac.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this  price point .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's just what we were looking for and it  works  great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's so quick and responsive that it makes  working / surfing  on a computer so much more pleasurable!
</DOC>
<DOC>
It  works  fine, and all the  software  seems to run pretty well.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I'm using this computer for  word processing ,  web browsing , some  gaming , and I'm learning  programming .
</DOC>
<DOC>
My wife was so excited to open the box, but quickly came to see that it did not  function  as it should.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I wanted a computer that was quite, fast, and that had overall great  performance .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Apple "Help"  is a mixed bag.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It suddenly can not  work .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Harddrive  was in poor condition, had to replace it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  on/off switch  is a bit obscure in the rear corner.
</DOC>
<DOC>
My only complaint is the total lack of  instructions  that come with the mac mini.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be  gaming , otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I use it mostly for  content creation  ( Audio ,  video ,  photo editing ) and its reliable.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Screen  is bright and gorgeous.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The only solution is to turn the  brightness  down, etc.
</DOC>
<DOC>
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the  applications .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is robust, with a friendly  use  as all Apple products.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is fast and easy to  use .
</DOC>
<DOC>
And the fact that it comes with an  i5 processor  definitely speeds things up
</DOC>
<DOC>
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its  built in features  are a great help
</DOC>
<DOC>
Nice  screen ,  keyboard  works great!
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was amazed at how fast the  delivery  was.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I've installed to it additional  SSD  and  16Gb RAM .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  memory  was gone and it was not able to be used.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It  works  great and I am so happy I bought it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I like the  design  and ease of use with the  keyboard , plenty of  ports .
</DOC>
<DOC>
it definitely beats my old mac and the  service  was great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Web browsing  is very quick with  Safari browser .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I like the  lighted screen  at night.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is really easy to  use  and it is quick to  start up .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I've lived with the crashes and slow  operation  and restarts.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 USB3 Peripherals  are noticably less expensive than the  ThunderBolt  ones.
</DOC>
<DOC>
And mine had broke but I sent it in under  warranty -no problems.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's fast, light, and is perfect for  media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  battery  lasts as advertised (give or take 15-20 minutes), and the entire  user experience  is very elegant.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Thanks for the fast  shipment  and great  price .
</DOC>
<DOC>
!Excelent  performance ,  usability ,  presentation  and  time response .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The smaller  size  was a bonus because of space restrictions.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I blame the  Mac OS .
</DOC>
<DOC>
In fact I still use many Legacy programs  ( Appleworks ,  FileMaker Pro ,  Quicken ,  Photoshop  etc)!
</DOC>
<DOC>
I like the  operating system .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I love the  form factor .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's fast at  loading the internet .
</DOC>
<DOC>
So much faster and sleeker  looking .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Unfortunately, it runs  XP  and Microsoft is dropping  support  next April.
</DOC>
<DOC>
First off, I really do like my MBP... once used to the  OS  it is pretty easy to get around, and the  overall build  is great... eg the  keyboard  is one of the best to type on.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is made of such solid  construction  and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the  system  a bit.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Very nice  unibody construction .
</DOC>
<DOC>
This Macbook Pro is fast, powerful, and  runs  super quiet and cool.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's ok but doesn't have a  disk drive  which I didn't know until after I bought it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
There is no  HDMI receptacle , nor is there an  SD card slot  located anywhere on the device.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It came in brand new and  works  perfectly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It shouldn't happen like that, I don't have any  design app  open or anything.
</DOC>
<DOC>
MY  TRACKPAD  IS NOT WORKING.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It  looks  and  feels  solid, with a flawless  finish .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Price  was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to  price  showing on PC when I bought this product.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Then the  system  would many times not  power down  without a forced power-off.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  configuration  is perfect for my needs.
</DOC>
<DOC>
and the  speakers  is the worst ever.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Its the best, its got the  looks , super easy to  use  and love all you can do with the  trackpad !..
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Web surfuring  is smooth and seamless.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I'm overall pleased with the  interface  and the  portability  of this product.
</DOC>
<DOC>
This item is a beautiful piece, it  works  well, it is easy to  carry  and  handle .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It was also suffering from  hardware (keyboard)  issues, relatively slow  performance  and shortening  battery lifetime .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Runs  good and does the job, can't complain about that!
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's silent and has a very small  footprint  on my desk.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  exterior  is absolutely gorgeous.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It has a very high  performance , just for what I needed for.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective  design  involving the  intel 4000 graphics chipset .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 OSX Mountain Lion   soon to upgrade to  Mavericks .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I just bought the new MacBook Pro, the 13" model, and I can't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to  USB ports .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It  wakes  in less than a second when I open the  lid .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is the perfect  size  and  speed  for me.
</DOC>
<DOC>
THE  CUSTOMER SERVICE  IS TERRIFIC!!
</DOC>
<DOC>
My last laptop was a 17" ASUS gaming machine, which  performed  admirably, but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life, I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome, not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago.
</DOC>
<DOC>
However, it did not have any scratches, ZERO  battery cycle count  (pretty surprised), and all the  hardware  seemed to be working perfectly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
After fumbling around with the  OS  I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue.
</DOC>
<DOC>
And as for all the fancy  finger swipes  -- I just gave up and attached a  mouse .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I needed a laptop with big  storage , a nice  screen  and fast so I can  photoshop  without any problem.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I like coming back to  Mac OS  but this laptop is lacking in  speaker quality  compared to my $400  old HP laptop.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Shipped  very quickly and safely.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  thunderbolt port  is awesome!
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  performance  is definitely superior to any computer I've ever put my hands on.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's great for  streaming video  and other  entertainment uses .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I like the  design  and its  features  but there are somethings I think needs to be improved.
</DOC>
<DOC>
There were small problems with  Mac office .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I understand I should call  Apple Tech Support  about any variables(which is my purpose of writing this con) as variables could be a bigger future problem.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with  spec  of the new 27" Imacs.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It still  works  and it's extremely user friendly, so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
</DOC>
<DOC>
Its fast, easy to  use  and it  looks  great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
(but  Office  can be purchased) IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba!!
</DOC>
<DOC>
I haven't tried the one with  retina display ... Maybe in the future.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Performance  is much much better on the Pro, especially if you install an  SSD  on it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Note, however, that any existing  MagSafe accessories  you have will not work with the  MagSafe 2 connection .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The only thing I dislike is the  touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I dont want it too, I would recommend using a  mouse  with it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and  runs  very quiet, actually the  fans  aren't audible unlike my old pc
</DOC>
<DOC>
MAYBE The  Mac OS  improvement were not The product they Want to offer.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new  Mac ecosystem .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's absolutely wonderful and worth the  price !
</DOC>
<DOC>
I am please with the products ease of  use ; out of the box ready;  appearance  and  functionality .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Perfect for all my  graphic design  classes I'm taking this year in college :-)
</DOC>
<DOC>
I will not be using that  slot  again.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  OS  is fast and fluid, everything is organized and it's just beautiful.
</DOC>
<DOC>
They are simpler to  use .
</DOC>
<DOC>
!so nice .. stable .. fast .. now i got my  SSD  !
</DOC>
<DOC>
Also, in using the  built-in camera , my  voice recording  for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the "Star Wars" saga.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I love the quick  start up .
</DOC>
<DOC>
You just cannot beat the  functionality  of an Apple device.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Yet my mac continues to  function  properly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Graphics  are much improved.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase: Build Quality  - Seriously, you can't beat a  unibody construction .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It provides much more  flexibility for connectivity .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I want the  portability  of a tablet, without the limitations of a tablet and that's where this laptop comes into play.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Mac tutorials  do help.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  technical support  was not helpful as well.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I got the new  adapter  and there was no change.
</DOC>
<DOC>
so i called  technical support .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Came with  iPhoto  and  garage band  already loaded.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Logic board  utterly fried, cried, and laid down and died.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  sound  was crappy even when you turn up the  volume  still the same results.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 OSX Lion  is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is, I never expected to have an  application  crash within the first month, but I did.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The Macbook pro's  physical form  is wonderful.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The Mini's  body  hasn't changed since late 2010- and for a good reason.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  unibody construction  really does feel lot more solid than Apple's previous laptops.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 3D rendering  slows it down considerably.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Got this Mac Mini with  OS X Mountain Lion  for my wife.
</DOC>
<DOC>
fast, great  screen , beautiful  apps  for a laptop; priced  at 1100 on the apple website;amazon had it for 1098+ tax -  plus i had a 10% off coupon from amazon- cost  me 998 plus tax- 1070- OTD!
</DOC>
<DOC>
12.44 seconds to  boot .
</DOC>
<DOC>
All the  ports  are much needed since this is my main computer.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $900+ level only, and it is a  Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU  (similar to the $799 Mini), with  Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card  (this mini is  integrated Intel 4000 card ), and it even comes with  wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse , all put together in neat and nice  package .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Put a  cover  on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Within a few hours I was using the  gestures  unconsciously.
</DOC>
<DOC>
This mac does come with an  extender cable  and I'm using mine right now hoping the  cable  will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  2.9ghz dual-core i7 chip  really out does itself.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is pretty snappy and  starts up  in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Not sure on  Windows 8 .
</DOC>
<DOC>
My one complaint is that there was no  internal CD drive .

This newer netbook has no  hard drive  or  network lights .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was having a though time deciding between the 13" MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro 13" (Both baseline models,  priced  at 1,200 $ retail)
</DOC>
<DOC>
Not too expense and has enough  storage  for most users and many  ports .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  audio volume  is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is lightweight and the perfect  size  to carry to class.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was given a demonstration of  Windows 8 .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful  capabilities .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I thought that it will be fine, if i do some  settings .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Runs  very smoothly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Boot-up  slowed significantly after all  Windows updates  were installed.
</DOC>
<DOC>
More likely it will require replacing the  logic board  once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the  internet ,  word processing ,  graphic design  and  gaming .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to  setup  and  install , but I am learning as I go and could use a  tutorial  to learn how to use some of the  features  I was use to on the PC especially the  right mouse click menu .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Runs  real quick.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Buy the separate  RAM memory  and you will have a rocket!
</DOC>
<DOC>
Since the machine's slim  profile  is critical to me, that was a problem.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 WiFi capability ,  disk drive  and multiple  USB ports  to connect scale and printers was all that was required.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  SD card reader  is slightly recessed and upside down (the  nail slot on the card  cannot be accessed), if this was a self ejecting  slot  this would not be an issue, but its not.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Soft  touch ,  anodized aluminum  with laser cut precision and no flaws.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Simple details, crafted  aluminium  and real  glass  make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops.
</DOC>
<DOC>
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed  aluminum  .
</DOC>
<DOC>
After all was said and done, I essentially used that $450 savings to buy  16GB of RAM , TWO  Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives  and an  OWC upgrade kit  to install the second  hard drive .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The Dell Inspiron is fast and has a  number pad on the keyboard , which I miss on my Apple laptops.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was concerned that the downgrade to the  regular hard drive  would make it unacceptably slow but I need not have worried - this machine is the fastest I have ever owned...
</DOC>
<DOC>
This one still has the  CD slot .
</DOC>
<DOC>
No  HDMI port .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I had to  install Mountain Lion  and it took a good two hours.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Customization  on mac is impossible.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I am replacing the  HD  with a  Micron SSD  soon.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Plus  two finger clicking  as a replacement for the  right click button  is surprisingly intuitive.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  SuperDrive  is quiet.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  power plug  has to be connected to the  power adaptor  to charge the  battery  but won't stay connected.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  battery  was completely dead, in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside.
</DOC>
<DOC>
if yo like  practicality  this is the laptop for you.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  OS  is great.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I tried several  monitors  and several  HDMI cables  and this was the case each time.
</DOC>
<DOC>
CONS:  Price  is a bit ridiculous, kinda heavy.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The troubleshooting said it was the  AC adaptor  so we ordered a new one.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Fan  only comes on when you are  playing a game .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Which it did not have, only 3  USB 2 ports .
</DOC>
<DOC>
No  startup disk  was not included but that may be my fault.
</DOC>
<DOC>
There is no  "tools" menu .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a  word program .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Needs a  CD/DVD drive  and a bigger  power switch .
</DOC>
<DOC>
My laptop with  Windows 7  crashed and I did not want  Windows 8 .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Easy to  install  also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to  configure for ADSl cable or wifi .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Nice  packing .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I switched to this because I wanted something different, even though I miss  windows .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Apple no longer includes  iDVD  with the computer and furthermore, Apple doesn't even offer it anymore!
</DOC>
<DOC>
I also wanted  Windows 7 , which this one has.
</DOC>
<DOC>
At first, I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the  Mac system .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I am used to computers with  windows  so I am having a little difficulty finding my way around.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It just  works  out of the box and you have a lot of cool  software  included with the  OS .
</DOC>
<DOC>
its as advertised on here..... it  works  great and is not a waste of money!
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Runs  like a champ.....
</DOC>
<DOC>
Premium  price  for the  OS  more than anything else.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was a little concerned about the  touch pad  based on reviews, but I've found it fine to work with.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The sound as mentioned earlier isn't the best, but it can be solved with  headphones .
</DOC>
<DOC>
However, the experience was great since the  OS  does not become unstable and the  application  will simply shutdown and reopen.
</DOC>
<DOC>
If you ask me, for this  price  it should be included.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  battery  is not as shown in the product photos.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Shipping  was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more...
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  retina display display  make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of  compact computing  out there.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Instead, I'll focus more on the actual  performance and feature set of the hardware  itself so you can make an educated decision on which Mac to buy.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Other  ports  include  FireWire 800 ,  Gigabit Ethernet ,  MagSafe port ,  Microphone jack .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Additionally, there is barely a  ventilation system  in the computer, and even the simple activity of  watching videos  let alone  playing steam games  causes the laptop to get very very hot, and in fact impossible to keep on lap.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Chatting with  Acer support , I was advised the problem was corrupted  operating system files .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I'm struggle with finding the correct  keys  (but that was expected).
</DOC>
<DOC>
Many people complain about the new  OS , and it's urgent for Apple to fix it asap!
</DOC>
<DOC>
Now that I have upgraded to  Lion  I am much happier about  MAC OS  and have just bought an iMac for office.
</DOC>
<DOC>
User upgradeable  RAM  and  HDD .
</DOC>
<DOC>
But I wanted the Pro for the  CD/DVD player .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was a little worry at first because I don't have a lot of experience with  os.x  and  windows  has always been second nature to me after many years of using  windows .
</DOC>
<DOC>
With the  softwares  supporting the use of other  OS  makes it much better.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I then upgraded to  Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I was considering buying the Air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful  performance  and seems much more convenient, even though it's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier.
</DOC>
<DOC>
At home and the office it gets plugged into an  external 24" LCD screen , so  built in screen size  is not terribly important.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Just beware no  DVD slot  so when I went to  install software  I had on CD I couldn't.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small, portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a  word processing program  to do so.
</DOC>
<DOC>
This version of MacBook Pro runs on a  third-generation CPU ("Ivy Bridge") , not the latest  fourth-generation Haswell CPU  the 2013 version has.
</DOC>
<DOC>
No  Cd Rom  in the new version there's no way I'm spending that kind of money on something has less  features  than the older version.
</DOC>
<DOC>
the  volume  is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t  volume  to be so lowan i hate that about this computer
</DOC>
<DOC>
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a  case  to protect it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I got this at an amazing  price  from Amazon and it arrived just in time.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Every time I  log into the system  after a few hours, there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Put a  SSD  and use a  21" LED screen , this  set up  is silky smooth!
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  case  is now slightly larger than the previous generation, but the lack of an  external power supply  justifies the small increase in size.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I had to buy a  wireless mouse  to go with it, as I am old school and hate the  pad , but knew that before I bought it, now it  works  great, need to get adjusted to the  key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding.
</DOC>
<DOC>
When considering a Mac, look at the total  cost of ownership  and not just the initial  price tag .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Has all the other  features  I wanted including a  VGA port ,  HDMI ,  ethernet  and 3  USB ports .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the  rubber pads  found on the bottom of the computer for grip.
</DOC>
<DOC>
It's a decent computer for the  price  and hopefully it will last a long time.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The nicest  part is the low  heat output  and ultra quiet  operation .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I will  upgrade the ram  myself (because with this model you can you can do it) later on.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  price  is 200 dollars down.
</DOC>
<DOC>
this Mac Mini does not have a  built-in mic , and it would seem that its  Mac OS 10.9  does not handle  external microphones  properly.
</DOC>
<DOC>
A lot of  features  and  shortcuts  on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Wasn't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the  IOS system  on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different.
</DOC>
<DOC>
air has higher  resolution  but the  fonts  are small.
</DOC>
<DOC>
 working  with Mac is so much easier, so many cool  features .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I like the  brightness  and  adjustments .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I only wish this mac had a  CD/DVD player  built in.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had  backlit keys .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The only thing I miss are the  "Home/End" type keys  and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long.
</DOC>
<DOC>
So happy with this purchase, I just wish it came with  Microsoft Word .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It has enough  memory  and  speed  to run my business with all the  flexibility  that comes with a laptop.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  speed , the  simplicity , the  design .. it is lightyears ahead of any PC I have ever owned.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  battery life  is excellent, the  display  is excellent, and  downloading apps  is a  breeze.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  screen , the  software  and the smoothness of the  operating system .
</DOC>
<DOC>
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a  slim plastic case  covering it.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I also made a  recovery USB stick .
</DOC>
<DOC>
But with this laptop, the  bass  is very weak and the  sound  comes out sounding tinny.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  built quality  is really good, I was so Happy and excited about this Product.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I am loving the fast  performance  also.
</DOC>
<DOC>
Further, this Mac Mini has a sloppy  Bluetooth interface  (courtesy of the  Mac OS ) and the  range  is poor.
</DOC>
<DOC>
If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the  start menu  will automatically come up.
</DOC>
<DOC>
My only gripe would be the need to add more  RAM .
</DOC>
<DOC>
Fine if you have a  touch screen .
</DOC>
<DOC>
As far as user type - I dabble in everything from  games  (WoW) to  Photoshop , but nothing professionally.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I re-seated the  "WLAN" card  inside and re-installed the  LAN device drivers .
</DOC>
<DOC>
This by far beats any computer out on the market today  built  well,  battery life  AMAZING.
</DOC>
<DOC>
The  OS  is easy, and offers all kinds of surprises.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I had to get  Apple Customer Support  to correct the problem.
</DOC>
<DOC>
A veryimportant feature is  Firewire 800  which in my experience works better then  USB3  (in PC enabled with  USB3 )I was not originally sold on the  MAC OS  I felt it was inferior in many ways To  Windows 7 .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I like  iTunes , the apparent  security , the  Mini form factor , all the nice  graphics stuff .
</DOC>
<DOC>
The first time I used the  card reader  it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to  remove the card .
</DOC>
<DOC>
After replacing the  spinning hard disk  with an  ssd drive , my mac is just flying.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I know some people complained about  HDMI  issues but they released a  firmware patch  to address that issue.
</DOC>
<DOC>
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best  specs .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 packing  and everything was perfect
</DOC>
<DOC>
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the  mother boards .
</DOC>
<DOC>
I seem to be having repeat problems as the  Mother Board  in this one is diagnosed as faulty, related to the  graphics card .
</DOC>
<DOC>
It also comes with  4G of RAM  but if you're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put  8G of RAM  in her and I've never used a computer that  performs  better.
</DOC>
<DOC>
This computer is also awesome for my sons  virtual home schooling .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Cost  is more as compared to other brands.
</DOC>
<DOC>
also...- excellent  operating system -  size  and  weight  for optimal  mobility - excellent  durability of the battery - the  functions provided by the trackpad  is unmatched by any other brand-
</DOC>
<DOC>
This  hardware  seems to be better than the iMac in that it isn't $1400 and smaller.
</DOC>
<DOC>
I've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with  software  or  updates .
</DOC>
<DOC>
the latest version does not have a  disc drive .
</DOC>
<DOC>
 Screen  - although some people might complain about low  res  which I think is ridiculous.
</DOC>
